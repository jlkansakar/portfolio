                I am currently enrolled at KEA (Copenhagen School of Design & Technology) majoring in IT-Architecture, with my projected time of graduation being january 2027.
                My interests are spread far and wide, but they do often have something to do with a pc. These interests are anything from chatting with friends, to gaming, to producing electronic music.
                I am a happy-go-lucky person, who always has a smile on his lips, and who isn't afraid for when the going gets tough either.
